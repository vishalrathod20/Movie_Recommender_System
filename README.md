# Movie Recommender System

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a Movie Recommender System using Streamlit. The system provides movie recommendations based on content-based filtering. Additionally, scikit-learn (sklearn) is utilized for implementing various machine learning algorithms that enhance the recommendation process.

## Features

- **Content-Based Recommendations**: The system recommends movies based on the content and features of the input movie. It analyzes movie attributes and finds similar movies to suggest.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit allows users to interact with the recommender system easily.
- **Integration with scikit-learn**: Leveraging scikit-learn for machine learning tasks to improve the accuracy of recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A Python library used for building interactive web applications.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A library used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
